<i><b>Invite your friends! Anyone can join if they have Byond!</b></i>

<i>Make sure to set your Special Role/Antagonist settings if you want to be traitor or other badguy roles.</i>
<i>If you end up playing traitor, actually perform your objectives. If you can't or don't want to, use adminhelp.</i>

<i>Note about Species: Make sure to check them each game as they do not save properly.</i>
