changes:
  - rscadd: "In light of the recent achievements of the Robotics department, new and upgraded exosuit schematics were delivered to SS13 exosuit fabricators as a reward from CentComm.
  - rscadd: "The countless hours of research, experimentation, and reverse-engineering of wrecks from the mining asteroid have paid off - the Research team has rediscovered the process of building Phazon exosuits. The parts and circuits have been made available in the exofabs and circuit printers."
  - rscadd: "The APLU Ripley exosuit has been refitted with asteroid mining purposes in mind. Its armour plating will provide extra protection against the brute attacks of asteroid alien lifeforms, and protect from gibtonite explosions. The leg servos were upgraded to provide faster movement."
  - rscadd: "There are rumours of some creative shaft miners discovering a way of augmenting APLU Ripley armour with trophy hides from goliath-type asteroid lifeforms..."
  - tweak: "Durand construction routines now require a phasic scanner module and a super capacitor to match Nanotrasen industry standards."
  - tweak: "The exosuit fire extinguisher now boasts a larger watertank, and carries a whole 1000u of water from the old 200u tank."
  - tweak: "The exosuit plasma converter's efficiency has been vastly improved upon, and its fuel consumption has been cut to nearly half of old values."
  - bugfix: "The exosuit sleeper interiors have been refitted to allow the occupants more freedom of movement, and the occupants may now eject at will.
  - bugfix: "The armour plating on all exosuits was fitted with reactive deflection systems specifically designed to stop the rapid slashes from xenomorph threats."
  - bugfix: "The Firefighter Ripley chassis were moved from the Exosuit Equipment section to the APLU Ripley section of exofab menus."
  - spellcheck: "Fixed some minor errors in the exosuit construction message syntax."
